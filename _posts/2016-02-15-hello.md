# Hello! 

## This site is under construction. In the meantime, here's a bit about me.

My name is Austin Fathman. I'm primarily a mobile developer who has strong interests in IoT, machine learning and computer vision. My primary platform is Android, however â€‹I also have done a few projects on iOS.

Education: I graduated from MIT with a  bachelor's in Computer Science.

Work: I'm currently working for Cambridge Mobile Telematics as a software engineer. I've worked with Professor K.P. Horn from MIT for my undergraduate thesis, and spent a couple of summers at APX Labs in Herndon, VA.
